# Simplesense Weather Insight — Construction Site Risk

Transforms Open-Meteo weather forecasts into hourly **work-stoppage risk assessments** for construction sites. Outputs composite risk scores and per-activity restrictions grounded in OSHA thresholds (1926.1417 crane ops, 1910.333 electrical work).

## Live Demo

[https://simplesense-weather-risk-jbgvmepvegrd7jtkk23nrz.streamlit.app/](https://simplesense-weather-risk-jbgvmepvegrd7jtkk23nrz.streamlit.app/)

## Quickstart

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

Open `http://localhost:8501` in your browser. Select a preset city or enter custom coordinates, choose a forecast window (1–7 days), and click **Get Risk Assessment**.

## How It Works

```
Open-Meteo API  →  Weather Client  →  Risk Engine  →  Streamlit UI
(no API key)       (async httpx)      (pure Python)    (interactive)
```

The risk engine evaluates four independent factors per hour and sums them into a composite score (0–100):

| Factor | Max contribution | STOP trigger |
|---|---|---|
| Wind speed / gusts | 70 pts | ≥45 mph effective |
| Precipitation | 30 pts | >0.3 mm active |
| Visibility | 20 pts | <200 m |
| Weather code (WMO) | 70 pts | Thunderstorm (codes 95/96/99) |

## Risk Levels

| Level | Score | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| GREEN | 0–39 | Normal operations |
| CAUTION | 40–69 | Elevated conditions — supervisors alerted |
| STOP | 70–100 | Work suspension required |

## Activity Restrictions

Evaluated independently from the composite score using direct OSHA threshold comparisons:

| Activity | Suspended when |
|---|---|
| Crane | Sustained wind >30 mph or gusts >35 mph (OSHA 1926.1417) |
| Exterior | Wind >40 mph or thunderstorm |
| Electrical | Any active precipitation (OSHA 1910.333) |
| General | STOP-level conditions or thunderstorm |
